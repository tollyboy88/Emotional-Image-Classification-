# Emotion Image Classifier (Offline)

An offline web-based image classifier that detects emotions or scenes such as **happy, sad, playground, and war ground** using a trained TensorFlow.js model. Fully functional without internet or servers.

## 🚀 Features
- Offline image prediction using TensorFlow.js
- Intuitive and responsive UI
- Easy to update model (more emotion classes coming soon)

## 📂 Current Classes
- Playground
- War Ground
- Happy
- Sad

Planned update:
- Angry
- Disgust
- Fear
- Surprise
- Neutral

## 🧠 Team Planning
- Solo development project for now
- Planned updates include:
  - Model retraining
  - UI enhancement
  - Progressive web app (PWA) support

## 🚀 Feature Release Plan
| Version | Features |
|--------|----------|
| v1.0   | 4-class offline image classification |
| v1.1   | Add 5 new emotion classes |
| v1.2   | Add webcam support for live image classification |
| v2.0   | Turn into installable PWA |

## 🛠️ Kanban Workflow (suggested via GitHub Projects)
**To Do:**
- Prepare README and documentation
- Train extended model

**In Progress:**
- Testing UI for expanded model
- Improving image pre-processing

**Done:**
- Built UI
- Integrated TensorFlow.js model

---

## 🐞 Bug Tracker
Create GitHub Issues for:
- Model not loading errors
- Incorrect prediction or low confidence
- UI freezing or not responding

---

## 🔁 Iterative Development Approach
1. Build MVP with 4 classes
2. Get feedback from users
3. Train and integrate larger model
4. Enhance UI and optimize performance

---

## 🚀 Product Launch Plan
- Package as a zipped app to share
- Optionally host on GitHub Pages for live demo
- Gather user feedback and iterate

---

## 📅 Roadmap
- [x] Offline classifier (v1.0)
- [ ] Add support for new emotion classes (v1.1)
- [ ] Deploy as installable PWA (v2.0)
- [ ] Add speech output or accessibility support
- [ ] Enable drag-and-drop image input

## 🧾 Team Retrospective (example after a sprint)
**What went well:**
- Model integrated smoothly with frontend
- Predictions are responsive and accurate for small dataset

**What could be improved:**
- Model accuracy can improve with more data
- UI could be more interactive

**Action items:**
- Add model version tracking
- Gather labeled data for additional emotions
